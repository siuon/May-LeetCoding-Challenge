             * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
               Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. 
               Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
  
             * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, 
               which causes all the following ones to be bad.
  
             * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. 
               Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
  
             * Example:
  
             * Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
  
             * call isBadVersion(3) -> false
             * call isBadVersion(5) -> true
             * call isBadVersion(4) -> true
  
             * Then 4 is the first bad version.
